# Chromatic-Equivalence-Classes-of-a-Graph
ABSTRACT
	This paper is an introduction to the Chromatic Equivalence Classes of the Graph. Chromatic Equivalence Classes of the Graph is defined and also Chromatic polynomials are defined, their properties are derived, and some practical methods for computing them are given.
	The value of the chromatic polynomial of a graph with n vertices gives the number of ways of properly colouring the graph, using Î» or fewer colours. Non-isomorphic graphs may possess the same chromatic polynomial. Two graphs G and H are said to be chromatically equivalent, written as G ~ H, if their chromatic polynomials are equal.
